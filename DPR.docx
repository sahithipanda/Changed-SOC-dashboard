4. System Architecture
The system follows a client-server architecture with the following components:

Frontend (Dash)
Interactive Dashboards: Display real-time threat data, risk scores, and trends.

Geographical Threat Map: Visualize the location of threats using maps.

Trend Analysis Graphs: Show attack trends over time using line charts and bar charts.

Real-Time Updates: Use WebSocket or Server-Sent Events (SSE) to push updates to the frontend.

Backend (Flask)
Data Collection:

Fetch data from threat intelligence feeds (OTX, VirusTotal, AlienVault).

Scrape dark web data using Scrapy or BeautifulSoup.

Monitor social media platforms (Twitter, Reddit) using APIs.

Collect internal network logs using rsyslog or Logstash.

Data Preprocessing:

Clean and preprocess data (remove duplicates, irrelevant data).

Perform text preprocessing for NLP (tokenization, stemming, lemmatization).

Enrich data with threat actor profiles and attack techniques using the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

AI/ML Models:

Train and deploy NLP models (BERT) for threat classification.

Implement clustering (DBSCAN) and anomaly detection (Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM).

Use time-series models (ARIMA, LSTM) for predictive analytics.

Automated Mitigation:

Provide actionable mitigation steps for detected threats.

Integrate with SIEM systems (e.g., Splunk) for automated responses.

Database
SQLite: Store structured data (e.g., internal network logs, threat intelligence feeds).

Integration
SIEM Systems: Integrate with Splunk for automated threat response.

External APIs: Fetch data from OTX, VirusTotal, AlienVault, Twitter, and Reddit.

5. Workflow and Functionality
Step 1: Run the Application
The client types python app/main.py in the terminal.

The application starts and opens a web interface at http://127.0.0.1:8050.

Step 2: Fake Data Generation
The application generates fake threat data (e.g., IP addresses, domains, threat types, severity levels).

The data is processed and visualized in real-time on the Dash interface.

Step 3: Client Interaction
The client interacts with the Dash interface to view:

Real-time threat visualizations (e.g., maps, charts).

Risk scores and mitigation recommendations.

The client can download reports (e.g., PDF or CSV) containing tasks for SOC analysts.

Step 4: Continuous Improvement
Continuously train AI models with fresh data.

Incorporate user feedback to refine the platform.

6. Implementation Steps
Step 1: Set Up the Project Structure
Create the Directory Structure:

Create a folder named app in the root directory of the old project.

Inside the app folder, create the following files:

main.py: Entry point to run the application.

data_generation.py: Script to generate fake threat data.

report_generation.py: Script to generate downloadable reports.

assets/: Folder for CSS and images (optional).

requirements.txt: List of dependencies.

Define the File Structure:

Ensure the directory structure is clear and organized to avoid errors during implementation.

Step 2: Install Dependencies
Create requirements.txt:

List all required Python libraries in the requirements.txt file.

Include libraries like dash, flask, pandas, faker, and reportlab.

Install Dependencies:

Run the command pip install -r requirements.txt to install all dependencies.

Step 3: Implement Fake Data Generation
Write the Data Generation Script:

In data_generation.py, create a function to generate fake threat data.

Use the Faker library to generate realistic IP addresses, domains, threat types, and severity levels.

Return the generated data as a Pandas DataFrame for easy processing.

Integrate with the Main Application:

Ensure the fake data generation function is called when the application starts.

Pass the generated data to the Dash frontend for visualization.

Step 4: Implement Report Generation
Write the Report Generation Script:

In report_generation.py, create functions to generate downloadable reports in PDF and CSV formats.

Use ReportLab for PDF generation and Pandas for CSV generation.

Ensure the reports include relevant threat data (e.g., threat type, severity, IP addresses).

Add Download Buttons to the Frontend:

In the Dash frontend, add buttons for downloading PDF and CSV reports.

Use Dash callbacks to trigger the report generation functions when the buttons are clicked.

Step 5: Build the Dash Interface
Create the Dash Application:

In main.py, initialize the Dash application and define its layout.

Include components like graphs, maps, and buttons for downloading reports.

Add Real-Time Updates:

Use Dash callbacks to update the frontend with real-time data.

Ensure the fake data generation function is called periodically to simulate real-time updates.

Step 6: Run the Application
Start the Application:

Run the command python app/main.py to start the application.

Open the web interface at http://127.0.0.1:8050 to view the platform.

7. Client Interaction
View Real-Time Data:

The client sees fake threat data visualized in real-time (e.g., bar charts, maps).

Download Reports:

The client clicks the "Download CSV Report" or "Download PDF Report" button to generate and download reports.

Explore Features:

The client can interact with the platform to explore all features (e.g., threat detection, risk scoring, mitigation recommendations).

8. Why This Approach?
Simple: No complex setup or dependencies.

Client-Friendly: Easy to run and interact with.

Demonstration-Ready: Fake data generation ensures the platform is always functional for demos.

Downloadable Reports: Provides actionable insights for SOC analysts.
